## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later (preferably the latest LTS version)
- Docker
- PNPM

Please make sure you have a Docker daemon running on your machine. This is required for the Supabase CLI to work.

### Installation

#### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Start the Next.js application

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

#### 5. Code Health (linting, formatting, etc.)

To format your code, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run format:fix
```

To lint your code, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

To validate your TypeScript code, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

Turborepo will cache the results of these commands, so you can run them as many times as you want without any performance impact.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

```
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web/                  # Next.js application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/             # App Router pages

### Environment Variables

You can configure the application by setting environment variables in the `.env.local` file.

Here are the available variables:

| Variable Name | Description | Default Value|
| --- | --- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | The URL of your SaaS application | `http://localhost:3000`|

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME_COLOR_DARK` | The default theme color of your SaaS product in dark mode | `#0a0a0a`|


## Architecture

This starter kit uses a monorepo architecture.

1. The `apps/web` directory is the Next.js application.
2. The `packages` directory contains all the packages used by the application.
3. The `packages/features` directory contains all the features of the application.
4. The `packages/ui` directory contains all the UI components.

### Marketing Pages

Marketing pages are located in the `apps/web/app/(marketing)` directory. These pages are used to showcase the features of the SaaS and provide information about the product.
